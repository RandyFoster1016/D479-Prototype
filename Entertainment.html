    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
  
    <ul>Entertainment: Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, 
      there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, 
      zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, 
      taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should 
       operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on 
       the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</ul>
