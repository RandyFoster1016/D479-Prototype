    <h2>Transportation</h2>
    
      
      <ul><li>Transportation: Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.</li>
        <li>Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. <li>Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.</li>
       <li>Ground Transportation: Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.</li><li> Private buses serve the rest of the island. <li>Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport.</li>
        <li> Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). <li>Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable.</li><li> Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</li>
